## üß© Key Concepts & Architecture

### State Management
- Uses **Zustand** for global state (projects, tasks, auth, notifications).
- All stores are typed and colocated in `src/store/`.

### UI/UX & Design System
- **Reusable Components:** Buttons, dropdowns, cards, tables, modals, notifications, etc.
- **Dark Mode:** Toggleable, persists user preference.
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, focus states.

### Forms & Validation
- **Project & Task Forms:** Robust validation, dynamic fields, member selection, tag input, date pickers.
- **Modals:** For project/task creation, editing, and confirmations.

### Notifications
- **ToastProvider:** Real-time, auto-dismissing toasts for feedback (success, error, info, warning).

### Customization
- **Tailwind CSS:** Easily customize theme, colors, fonts in `tailwind.config.js`.
- **Component Props:** All UI components are highly configurable via props.
